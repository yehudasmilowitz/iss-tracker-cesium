            <p>Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered what's whizzing by overhead? That might just be the
                International Space Station (ISS), a marvel of human ingenuity and collaboration orbiting Earth at an
                average altitude of 400 kilometers (250 miles)!</p>

            <p>This amazing scientific laboratory travels at a mind-boggling speed of about 28,000 kilometers (17,500
                miles) per hour, completing an orbit roughly every 90 minutes. That means it circles our planet 16 times
                a day! Imagine the view from up there ‚Äì a constant dance of breathtaking sunrises and sunsets.</p>

            <p>The ISS is a truly international effort, a shining example of what we can achieve when nations work
                together. Since its assembly began in 1998, astronauts and cosmonauts from various space agencies have
                lived and conducted groundbreaking research aboard the station. Their work has expanded our
                understanding of life in space, developed new technologies, and contributed to peaceful international
                cooperation.</p>

            <p>So next time you're stargazing, keep an eye out for the ISS! You might just catch a glimpse of this
                incredible human achievement zooming across the starry canvas. With the help of this interactive globe,
                you can even track its real-time position and feel a little closer to the wonders of space exploration.
